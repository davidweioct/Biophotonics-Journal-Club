## quantitative live cell imaging --> model

control of the gene expresion: timing switch irreversibility

quantitative live imaging of gene circuits in cells
Optics requirement:
1) 10~50 nm spatial resolution (40X dry objective), expansion microscopy, barcoded probes
2) 10~200 micro depth, fast imaging (limited by the imaging speed, small FOV)

## dual color cell imaging :
sample: PDMS microwell array, thymus cells
